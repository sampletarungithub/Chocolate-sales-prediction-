The Chocolate Sales Prediction project focuses on analyzing historical sales data to forecast future chocolate product demand. The objective is to help businesses optimize inventory management, plan production, and design effective marketing strategies by understanding sales patterns and trends.

In this project, historical chocolate sales data is collected and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify key factors influencing sales such as seasonality, festivals, pricing, promotions, and regional demand. Visualizations are used to uncover trends, monthly and yearly sales patterns, and product-wise performance.

Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest Regressor are implemented to predict future chocolate sales based on features like date, price, discounts, and previous sales. The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score to ensure prediction accuracy.

The final outcome provides actionable insights that assist businesses in demand forecasting, reducing stock shortages or overstocking, and improving overall sales planning.
